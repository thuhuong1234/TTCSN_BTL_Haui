        Development, look no further. Our homegrown, 100% customizable WordPress
        theme is built and constantly improved to be efficient unlike other
        WordPress templates in the market. It sets no boundary to design
        creativity, allowing all websites to be tailored to specific needs, and
        is by default optimized for speed and search engines. Moreover, we also
        focus on security, administrator’s ease of use and flexibility for
        future expansion.Many wonder why we choose WordPress over other open
        source content management system (CMS)? Currently WordPress powers 43.3%
        of all websites on the internet and is the world’s most popular and
        widely used content management system. From our experience working with
        multiple other CMS before, WordPress still comes in first as it is the
        only one that strikes a nice balance between the administrator’s ease of
        use in updating content, and the flexibility that web designers and
        developers need to build a website without restrictions.
